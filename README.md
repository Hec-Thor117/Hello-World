# Hello-World
My first repository on my quest to learn how to use GitHub after an unfortunate incident on VS Code...

### VS Code deleted **ALL** my projects! :angry:

I started learning how to code in January 2022 and all the projects that I had saved on my computer, my entire documented coding journey, just *vanished* a couple weeks ago.
VS Code had deleted all my files - from my first "Hello World" to a HangMan game that I was really proud of.

I am learning from my mistakes however, and am going to start using GitHub to store my projects to avoid that happening again.
